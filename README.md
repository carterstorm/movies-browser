# Movies browser

This is a platform that allows users to search and browse movies, popular actors and actresses, as well as their production history. The website was created base on a Figma project that I received at the end of my studies in online programming school. The application allows you to search for data using a search engine. In case of a search error, an appropriate message is displayed.

In the future, I would like to add the ability to change the theme. Adding your favorite people and videos to your favorites and saving them on the browser side in localStorage. I would also like to add the ability to sort videos by categories.
